        <h2>Sentiment Analysis: food reviews</h2>
        <p>
          This example demonstrated loading a pre-trained model and using it in the browser. This model is trained to
          predict the sentiment of a short restaurant review (as a score between 0 and 1). The training is done server side
          using Python and then converted into a TensorFlow.js model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model is trained using YELP reviews that have been truncated to a maximum of 20 words, only the
          2000 most used words in the reviews are used. You can experiment with the model on this page
